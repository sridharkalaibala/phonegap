#### How To Do This HACK

1. Create a new GitHub user (Ex: `example-user`). (I did this in a Chrome Ingognito browser so I didn't have to log out of my real user.)
1. Create a repo for that user (Ex: `example-repo`).
1. Create an empty folder on your computer.
1. Add [dates.txt](https://github.com/public-contributions/HACK/blob/master/dates/dates.txt) to that folder and modify with the dates you want to "draw" to your Public Contributions chart.
1. Add [dates.sh](https://github.com/public-contributions/HACK/blob/master/dates/dates.sh) to that folder and change `--author="public-contributions"` (Ex: `--author="example-user"`).
1. Open a terminal window and `cd` to your folder (which now has `dates.txt` and `dates.sh` in it).
1. Run `git init` to initialize the Git repo.
1. Run `./dates.sh`. (You may need to run `chmod +x dates.sh` first depending on how you created the file.)
1. Add the remote git origin. (Ex: `git remote add origin git@github.com:example-user/example-repo.git`.)
1. Run `git push`.
1. Visit your user page to see the chart. (Ex: `http://github.com/example-user`.)
